# algovisualizations

This react app visualizes basic Computer Science Algorithms listed below. It is built using react, emphasizing on utilizing a functional approach to composing components using Hooks. The simulation is displayed using react-vis library.

See link below for live demo:

## Visualization for the following algorithms:

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

### Drag slider to change speed of simulation, then hit reset.

# algovisualizations

This react app visualizes basic Computer Science Algorithms listed below. It is built using react, emphasizing on utilizing a functional approach to composing components using Hooks. The simulation is displayed using react-vis library.

See link below for live demo:

## Visualization for the following algorithms:

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

### Toggle desired algorithm to run

![Algorithm Picker](https://github.com/jrescalona96/algovisualizations/blob/master/public/demopic1.png)

### Drag slider to change speed of simulation.

### Drag slider to increase or decrease the number of working data. To see the values of each data item, decrease working data set to at most 50.
